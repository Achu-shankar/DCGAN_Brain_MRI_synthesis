## Train

This section provides instructions on how to train and customize the model for your specific needs.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- [Any other dependencies or tools required for training]

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Achu-shankar/DCGAN_Brain_MRI_sythesis.git
   cd DCGAN_Brain_MRI_sythesis

   
2. Change the model parameters and folder paths in the `config.py` file.
3. Run the `train.py` file to initiate the training process.

## Inference

To generate samples from the pretrained model, run the `inference.py` file. A model pretrained on the Brain MRI dataset is available in the `pretrained_models` folder.
